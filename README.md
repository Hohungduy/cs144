##Introduction

... This is my implemtation on CS144 LAB: Introduction to Networking Programming.
... There are 5 Labs but actually only 4 Labs are needed to code. The objective of Lab 5 is combining 4 former Labs.
... The detail task of each labs:
.....* Lab 1: TCP stop-and-wait
.....* Lab 2: TCP continous transfer (Selective Repeat) - Code based on Lab 1
.....* Lab 3: Simple Router: Implementation on Routing packet through a Router device.
.....* Lab 4: NAT transversal: Implementation on NAT. - Code based on Lab 3
.....* Lab 5:Combination of 4 former Labs.
